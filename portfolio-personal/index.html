  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Sandeep Kumar</strong>, a dedicated and enthusiastic MCA student at 
    <strong>KIET Group of Institutions</strong>. With a strong foundation in computer science and a deep passion 
    for software development, I specialize in both front-end and back-end technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have hands-on experience in creating interactive web applications using technologies like 
    <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python</strong>. I’m also comfortable working with 
    <strong>Python</strong> for backend scripting and NLP-based projects. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly 
    interfaces and solving real-world problems through code.
  </p>
  <p>
    So far, I’ve completed projects ranging from a <em>Pizza Ordering System</em> to a <em>Real-Time Chat App</em> and even a 
    <em>COVID-19 Sentiment Analyzer using RoBERTa</em>. I’m currently enhancing my skills further through internships, 
    where I work on practical frontend challenges like calculators, portfolios, and game clones (Flappy Bird).
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer, capable of designing scalable systems and intuitive user experiences.
    I’m constantly learning and eager to contribute to innovative tech teams.
  </p>
